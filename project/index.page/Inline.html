<h1>Inline Elements</H1>
<p>Inline element are used to markup text inside a block element like a paragraph or division.
	Each element does different things to the text.<b> This text is a strong element. This is in a bold (b) element</b> Blod and strong seem to be the same effect.
	This is emphasisesdd(smlds (em) text. It seems to loo the same as the italicized text here.<br><br>putting text inside quote elements, "like this quoted text here", makes the text display with 
	quotatiion marks around it. Code(code)tags are meant for source code examples. They look like <code>code text here.</code> The keyboard element(kbd) look the same, <kbd>keyboard text here</kbd>,
but is meant for examples of user entered data.<br> <br>Superscript and subscript elements do what they say.<sup>this is superscript</sup>and <sub>this is subscript.</sub><br><br>Span elements don't seem 
to do anything at all. I've put about every other inside span tags.
Can you tell which is which?</p>
